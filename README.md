## About The Game

**Gelap** is an immersive first-person, open-world horror game that drags players into the unsettling atmosphere of Depok after dark. The game focuses on psychological horror, exploration, and narrative, drawing inspiration from local urban legends and real-world locations. You are not a hero; you are a survivor, and your only goal is to uncover the truth behind the encroaching darkness before it consumes you entirely.

This repository serves as the official development hub and backup for the project, built with **Unreal Engine**.

## Key Features

* **Authentic Open World:** Explore a faithful, albeit twisted, recreation of real locations in Depok. Every street and alley could hold a secret or a threat.
* **Atmospheric Horror:** Experience a constant state of tension and dread. The horror comes from the environment, the sound design, and the feeling of being watched, not just cheap jump scares.
* **Narrative-Driven Exploration:** Piece together a fragmented story by finding clues, notes, and environmental storytelling elements scattered throughout the world.
* **Stealth and Survival:** You are vulnerable. Avoid direct confrontation by using stealth, hiding, and running. Resources are scarce, and every decision matters.
* **Dynamic Environment:** The world is not static. Certain events may trigger based on time, location, or player actions, ensuring a terrifyingly unpredictable experience.

## The World: Depok After Dark

The game world is a meticulously crafted environment based on real locations, each with its own role in the unfolding mystery. Key areas include:

* **SMAN 6 Depok:** The starting point, a familiar place that has become unnervingly foreign.
* **Jalan Rotan & Makam Kopo:** A dense, dark residential road leading to an old cemetery.
* **Wisma Cakra:** The character's home, a supposed safe haven that no longer feels secure.
* **Jalan Raya Krukut:** A major road that serves as a lifeline, but is now fraught with danger.
* **SMPN 17 Depok (Abandoned):** An old, derelict school rumored to be a source of strange occurrences.
* **Gardu Induk PLN Gandul:** An imposing industrial structure with a dark secret.
* **Mor Cafe Cinere:** A once-lively spot, now a silent testament to a world gone wrong.
* **Jalan Limo Raya:** The long road back, where the journey's true nature is revealed.
